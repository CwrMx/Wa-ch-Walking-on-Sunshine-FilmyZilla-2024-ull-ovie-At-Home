Walking on Sunshine: A Jukebox Musical That Stumbles in Its Search for Rhythm

"Walking on Sunshine," a 2014 British romantic jukebox musical, attempts to capture the carefree spirit of the 1980s with a sunny Italian backdrop and a soundtrack filled with iconic hits. However, despite its energetic performances and vibrant visuals, the film ultimately falls short of delivering a truly engaging or memorable cinematic experience. Its predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional depth leave audiences feeling like they've heard this tune before, and not in a good way.

Where to Watch "Walking on Sunshine" - Showtimes and Locations Near You:

"Walking on Sunshine" has concluded its theatrical run, but the musical journey continues on various platforms:

Digital Purchase and Rental: "Walking on Sunshine" is available for purchase or rental on major digital platforms such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play Movies & TV, and YouTube.
"Walking on Sunshine" - Love, Secrets, and a Wedding in Puglia: Exploring the Plot and Characters:

The film opens with a bittersweet farewell between Taylor and her summer fling, Raf, on the sun-kissed beaches of Puglia, Italy. Three years later, Taylor returns to Puglia for a holiday, only to discover that her sister, Maddie, is about to marry... Raf!

As the wedding preparations unfold, Taylor struggles to conceal her past relationship with Raf, fearing it will shatter her sister's happiness. Meanwhile, Maddie's ex-boyfriend, Doug, arrives, determined to win her back, adding another layer of complexity to the already tangled love triangle.

Amidst the chaos of wedding planning, hen parties, and stag dos, the characters navigate their feelings, confront their pasts, and ultimately discover the true meaning of love and happiness.

A Cast Filled with Energy but Lacking Depth:

Hannah Arterton as Taylor: Arterton delivers an energetic performance as Taylor, capturing the character's initial reluctance to reveal her past and her eventual embrace of her true feelings. However, the character lacks depth and complexity, making it difficult for audiences to fully invest in her emotional journey.
Annabel Scholey as Maddie: Scholey portrays Maddie with a mix of enthusiasm and vulnerability, but the character's motivations and decisions often feel contrived, lacking the authenticity that could have made her more relatable.
Giulio Berruti as Raf: Berruti brings a charming presence to the role of Raf, but the character is largely underdeveloped, serving primarily as a catalyst for the film's romantic entanglements.
A Jukebox Musical That Misses the Beat:

"Walking on Sunshine" attempts to capitalize on the nostalgia of 1980s pop music, but its execution falls short. The film's musical numbers, while energetically performed, feel disconnected from the narrative, often serving as interludes rather than integral parts of the story. The song choices, while recognizable, lack the thematic resonance that could have elevated the film's emotional impact.

Is "Walking on Sunshine" a Real Story?

"Walking on Sunshine" is a fictional narrative that draws inspiration from the conventions of the romantic comedy genre. While the film's characters and situations are not based on real-life events, its exploration of themes such as love, heartbreak, and second chances resonates with audiences.

What Happened at the End of the "Walking on Sunshine" Movie?

In a predictable turn of events, Taylor finally confesses her love for Raf, and they end up together. Maddie, realizing that Raf's heart belongs to her sister, gracefully steps aside, embracing her newfound freedom and independence. The film concludes with a celebratory dance number on the beach, leaving the characters with a sense of hope and happiness.

Where in Puglia Was "Walking on Sunshine" Filmed?

"Walking on Sunshine" was filmed in the picturesque Salento region of Puglia, Italy. The film's stunning locations, including the Piazza del Duomo in Lecce, the beaches of Torre San Giovanni, and the charming town of Presicce, add a visual layer of romance and escapism to the narrative.

Is "Walking on Sunshine" a Good Movie?

"Walking on Sunshine" has received mixed reviews, with critics praising its energetic performances and vibrant visuals, but criticizing its predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional depth. The film's reliance on nostalgia and its formulaic approach to the romantic comedy genre ultimately hinder its overall impact.

Who Ends Up with Raf in "Walking on Sunshine"?

In a predictable twist, Raf ends up with Taylor, his former summer fling, after Maddie realizes that their relationship is not based on true love.

A Deeper Dive into the Themes of "Walking on Sunshine":

Despite its shortcomings, "Walking on Sunshine" attempts to explore several themes:

The Power of Love and Second Chances: The film's central love triangle explores the complexities of love, heartbreak, and the possibility of second chances. Taylor and Raf's rekindled romance suggests that love can endure even after years of separation.
Sisterhood and the Importance of Family: The film's portrayal of Taylor and Maddie's relationship highlights the importance of sisterhood, the bonds of family, and the sacrifices we make for those we love.
The Search for Identity and Self-Discovery: Maddie's decision to end her engagement with Raf and embrace her independence reflects a journey of self-discovery and the realization that true happiness comes from within.
The Nostalgia of the 1980s: The film's use of 1980s pop music evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding audiences of a time of carefree fun and youthful exuberance.
Conclusion: "Walking on Sunshine" - A Jukebox Musical That Fails to Find Its Groove

"Walking on Sunshine" is a jukebox musical that attempts to capture the spirit of the 1980s with a sunny Italian backdrop and a soundtrack filled with iconic hits. However, its predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional depth prevent it from reaching its full potential. While the film's energetic performances and vibrant visuals may entertain some viewers, it ultimately falls short of delivering a truly memorable or impactful cinematic experience.


Is ‘Walking on Sunshine’ Streaming?

No, Walking on Sunshine is not yet available to stream. Walking on Sunshine will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If Walking on Sunshine arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.

Is ‘Walking on Sunshine’ In Theaters?

Absolutely! Audiences can catch Walking on Sunshine in theaters starting June 14, 2024 - right during the Father’s Day frame. According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first movie.

Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror flick The Watchers premiered on June 7. Previously, the film was pushed back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as Walking on Sunshine. However, The Watchers eventually returned to its initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s directorial debut, The Watchers follows a 28-year-old Mina (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.

Also coming in hot this June is Walking on Sunshine, which also premiered on June 7, 2024. Serving as the franchise’s fourth installment since its previous release in 2020, Walking on Sunshine reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as they work outside the system to investigate corruption within the Miami Police Department and get their hands dirty to prove their innocence.
